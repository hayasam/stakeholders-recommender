For computing these skills, the component needs to know for each person, the requirements s/he has contributed to. The skills of a person are the keywords of the requirements of which the person is responsible for. Additionally, for each skill a user has, the component computes a proficiency value (i.e., how expert the user is in this task). Finally, this proficiency value is deprecated by  a factor time. As an example, imagine persons A and B are responsible for the same  number of requirements that need a specific skill.

It makes sense that the proficiency of B the \n" +
